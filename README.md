# PostgresDb [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeinopSys/PHP-PostgreSQL-Database-Class.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/SeinopSys/PHP-PostgreSQL-Database-Class) [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/seinopsys/postgresql-database-class/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/seinopsys/postgresql-database-class) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/seinopsys/postgresql-database-class/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/seinopsys/postgresql-database-class) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/seinopsys/postgresql-database-class/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/seinopsys/postgresql-database-class)

This project is a PostgreSQL version of [joshcam](https://github.com/joshcam)'s [MysqliDb Class](https://github.com/joshcam/PHP-MySQLi-Database-Class), that supports the basic functionality and syntax provided by said class, tailored specifically to PostgreSQL.

## Installation

This class requires PHP 5.6 or 7+ to work. You can either place `PostgresDb.php` in your project and require/include it, or use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (recommended)

    composer require seinopsys/postgresql-database-class:^2.0

## Usage

```php
require "PostgresDb.php";
$Database = new PostgresDb($database_name, $host, $username, $password);
```

For a more in-depth description see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)

## Upgrading from `1.x`

 1. **`where()` and arrays**

    From 2.0 onwards the following syntax for the `where` method has been deprecated in favor of using arrays to search multiple items using `IN`.

    ```php
    $Database->where('id', array('<=' => 1));
    ```

    Instead, use the 3rd parameter to specify an operator if `=` isn't what you want, like this:

    ```php
    $Database->where('id', 1, '<=');
    ```
 2. **`orderBy()` default direction**
 
     Since [the default](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-order.html) in POstgreSQL is `ASC` I've updated the default sort order of said method to reflect that.
   
     You should check for any usages of the `orderBy()` method where the second parameter is not set, and set it to the old default: `DESC`.
   
 3. **Column name transofrmation changes**
 
     Starting with version `2.0` column names are escaped/handled differently.  The [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS) state that all column names are lowercase by default when unquoted, but when quoted the casing should be preserved. The old version of the library converted column names to lowercase in some cases but not in others, leading to inconsistencies.
     
     A uniform escape function has been introduced internally for column names which causes anything that doesn't fit the unquoted restrictions (keywords & uppercase/invalid characters) will cause the column names to be quoted. Check the examples below to see if you need to make any changes based on how you refer to databse columns in your code.
     
     | Database column | Referred to as (in code) | Code change |
     |-----------------|--------------------------|--------|
     |`column_name`|`column_name`|_✔️ No action needed_<br><small>These can safely be used as-is</small>|
     |`order`<br>`user`<br>`select`|`order`<br>`user`<br>`select`|_✔️ No action needed_<br><small>Keywords are automatically quoted</small>|
     |`áccénts`|`áccénts`|_✔️ No action needed_<br><small>They will still be quoted, but it should not affect the behavior</small>|
     |`sp3cǐaŧ_¢h4r$`|`sp3cǐaŧ_¢h4r$`|_✔️ No action needed_<br>[<small>But why?</small>](https://media.giphy)|
     |`column_name`<br>`áccénts_ümläut_ëtc`|`Column_Name`<br>`Áccénts_Ümläut_Ëtc`|✖️ Use lowercase letters<br><small>The changes will now cause your column name to become quoted and refer to a column that does not exist.</small>|
     |`Column_Name`<br>`Áccénts`|`column_name`<br>`áccénts`|✖️ Use `Column_Name`/`Áccénts` instead<br><small>Column names with uppercase letters can only ever be accessed if the name is double-quoted. The changes will cause valid lowercase column names to be left unquoted, breaking this approach (if it even worked in the first place).</small>|

 4. **Remove defunct `delete()` `$numRows` argument**
  
    This method previously accepted an array as it second parameter which it passed along to the `LIMIT` query generator, but since this syntax is not supported by PostgreSQL this argument has been removed & replaced with the `$returnColumn` argument
    
 5. **`query()` removal, `rawQuery()`+`rawQuerySingle()` rename & behavior change**
  
    The `query()` method was ambigous and there was no point in keeping it around in its original form, so the `rawQuery*()` methods have dropped the `raw` prefix and are now simply called `query()` and `querySingle()`. The old method names have been taged with `@deprecated` and will now emit `E_USER_DEPRECATED` errors when run.
